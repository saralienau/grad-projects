# Classification Model Project

## Description

The goal of the project was to explore creating a classification model to predict how quickly a pet would be adopted based on data in its PetFinder profile (e.g., within 1 week, 1 month, 2-3 months or longer)

In business terms, you can think of the core process of an animal shelter as similar to an inventory management problem. The better you understand the rate at which you can move the inventory (find an animal a home), the more animals you can serve. Having a reasonable estimate for how long an animal may stay at a shelter also helps the shelter plan for when they have the capacity to accept more animals. Also, knowing the estimated length of stay helps the shelter plan for how to care for the animal and which animals may need more promotion to be placed in the right home.

The assignment involved:

- Performing an exploratory data analysis.
- Preparing the data for modeling.
- Exploring multiple algorithms (e.g., decision trees, nearest neighbor, support vector machines, and several ensemble methods) 
- Tuning the parameters of each algorithm to improve accuracy.  
- Assess which model is the best and, if any, could be used to solve the business problem.  In this case, provide a reasonable estimate of how quickly a pet would be adopted.

## Deliverables

A single notebook with report sections discussing the business problem, data source, EDA, and code sections fitting models with notes on choices made and discussion of intermediate and final results.

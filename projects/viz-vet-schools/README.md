# Explore US Veterinary Medical Colleges

## Description

The Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) makes available information for prospective veterinary students.

* [Profile of Admitted Students Tool](https://www.aavmc.org/additional-pages/admitted-student-statistics.aspx) – helps applicants understand the admissions landscape at each college of veterinary medicine where they might apply. 
* [AAVMC Cost Comparison Tool](https://www.aavmc.org/students-applicants-and-advisors/exploring-the-cost-of-a-veterinary-medical-education) – helps applicants understand and plan for the costs associated with becoming a veterinarian.

*Screenshots of a couple of [examples](AAVMC-Examples.pdf) of the charts from tools above.*

The AAVMC has very helpful data! But I felt there was a **much better story** that could be told with different data visualizations. 
 
The goal of my project is to help prospective students, and likely their parents, get an overview of the 30 vet schools in the US and learn a bit more about the path through vet school, to include:

* Admission is highly competitive (1 in 10 are accepted) for about 3000 seats per year across the 30 schools
* “Escalating demand” is driving students to apply to vet schools outside their home state, triggering higher out-of-state tuition rates
* There’s a big difference between resident & non-resident costs ($100K+) and students are graduating with significant debt (over $150K)
* Schools vary in how they help students minimize that debt
* Explore the options for non-resident students by seats available, competition for admission and costs
* Plus, compare how the colleges stack up across over two dozen metrics

# Time Series Analysis Project

## Description

The following is a time series analysis of the intake of stray cats and dogs into a city animal control shelter.  The goal is to explore developing a model to forecast the intake of stray cats and dogs that performs better than simply guessing that *"the intake will be about the same as last year."*  The volume of animals coming into a shelter is essentially a demand forecast that drives the bulk of the variable costs for the organization.  Thus, a better forecast could lead to more effective management of an animal shelter.

## Deliverables

- [Final Report](Report.pdf) - The report is a mix of discussing the application of the analysis techniques on stray animal intake and demonstrating my understanding of time series analysis concepts.

# COVID Crashes Kitten Season

## Description

The stay-at-home orders to *"flatten the curve"* of the COVID-19 pandemic came at the worst possible time for the animal sheltering community.  It was described as a "gut punch" to not be out and about rounding up kittens as we entered the peak of their reproductive cycle known as "kitten season."  For three decades spaying and neutering the new crop of kittens each year had been a critical component of animal lifesaving efforts.  Austin, Texas operates one of the largest animal shelters in the country and makes the data for the Austin Animal Center available on the city's data portal.

For a visualization assignment, I was curious to explore how COVID impacted kitten season.  It turned out to be a dramatic impact - perhaps an additional 1000 cats roaming Austin!

## Deliverables

- [Dashboard Image](Dashboard.pdf)
- [Interactive Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sara.lienau#!/vizhome/AAC_Covid_Kitten_Season/Dashboard) - Designed more as a static infographic there is not a lot of interactivity.  But there are a few tooltips and the ability to adjust the survival rates of different age groups in the online version.

- Code
  - [Tableau (.twbx) and Data](code-tableau) - The assignment provided the opportunity get creative with Tableau's level of detail calculations to shape the data into a form to made the charts easy to create.  I documented my approach in the workbook.

# Portfolio of Projects

The following are some of the projects I completed during the [**data analytics** master's degree](https://www.rockhurst.edu/data-analytics) program at [Rockhurst University](https://www.rockhurst.edu/) in Kansas City, Missouri.

The program emphasizes not only the need for technical proficiency but equally the ability to apply techniques to real business problems and effectively communicate advanced data topics to managers and colleagues with less technical expertise.

The material available here includes various forms of communicating results to technical and non-technical audiences and the code and data behind the analysis in many cases.


## Data Analysis Projects
- [**Geo-spatial analysis**](projects/project-geo-spatial) to recommend prime spots to locate a new business by incorporating economic development survey data, census statistics, and points of interest extracted from online maps.
- Explored [**classification algorithms**](projects/project-classification) to predict how quickly a pet is adopted based on its PetFinder profile.
- [**Time series analysis**](projects/project-time-series) of the intake of stray cats and dogs at an animal shelter.
- Used [**text mining**](projects/project-text-mining) to tackle a literature review project summarizing the topics covered in a daily email newsletter and measured the positive or negative sentiment of highlighted content.



## Data Visualization Projects
- [**Explore Vet Schools**](projects/viz-vet-schools) - a tool for prospective students to explore the 30 US veterinary medical colleges by location, class size, academic requirements, resident vs. out-of-state acceptance rates, costs, and debt at graduation.
- [**Illustrate**](projects/viz-kitten-season) the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on cat intake during "kitten season" at the Austin Animal Center.
- Dashboard to [**manage shelter capacity**](projects/viz-dog-los) by monitoring *"length of stay"* of dogs at the Austin Animal Center.
